                        If ten years ago you told me that in ten years I would be thinking of changing my career, I would say that you've no idea what you're talking about. After all, I've finally got into a place I've always dreamt of: a good and well-paid job in one of the world's top organizations in the space sector. Given that it took me a couple of years to get there, my mind was 100% set about it, and I was pretty sure I knew what I wanted to do until retirement.<br />
                        <br />
                        Without getting into the details of why I decided to change (at least not at this time), I find myself writing this blog post ten years later. I think it is safe to say that the first lesson I've learned is to never say never.<br />
                        <br />
                        But before I get into the subject of the 'mid-career transition to infosec' and tell you what my grand plan is, there are a couple of things I wanted to get out of the way.<br />
                        <br />
                        First of all, a quick disclaimer - I haven't transitioned yet. In fact, it's been only a few months since I've decided and painted my new target, and only now I'm finally starting to have an idea (although still in an early draft) of what the transition plan will look like.<br />
                        <br />
                        On the other hand, it's not like I'm starting just now. I'm halfway through my OSCP (which I will describe in future posts), and this post series (or at least the first couple of posts) is written partially based on the experience I have already gained.<br />
                        <br />
                        Another thing I want to mention upfront is that I'm going to skip a few initial steps of this adventure. Those are: why did I choose infosec (offensive security in particular), what was my thought process there, what else was I considering, etc.; that's because it doesn't bring much to this conversation and, since it's a longer story to tell, I think it deserves a dedicated post.<br />
                        <br />
                        Writing a blog is one of the steps on my transition plan and there are several reasons for that. For one, writing things down helps visualize them and I think that visualizing your goal is one of the most critical steps in achieving it. Second, it makes me go through my plan multiple times and forces me to think about whether it makes sense, what else I should think of doing, and what I should avoid doing. Future posts will summarize my progress in this endeavor, which should help me stay in check and give me yet another opportunity to review the next steps and the overall direction I'm going towards. I will approach it more like a diary where I can put my thoughts as I progress. I also don't think I will publish it immediately, but only once I make an actual progress, feel more confident that I can achieve my goals and see that what I do actually works.<br />
                        <br />
                        So far in my journey I haven't encountered many people who have done what I'm trying to do, but that doesn't mean there are none. Although most of the stories you hear are about getting into infosec straight after university, I'm sure many people are trying (or would like) to switch their careers in their 30s or even later. If you are one of those folks, I hope this blog series will come in handy even if it doesn't provide a clear path through to reach your goal (everyone's way will look differently) - at least you know that you're not alone (and if you reach out, I will know I'm not alone either).<br />
                        <br />
                        Lastly, one of the things I've learned about pentesting over the last few months is that there's this rule which says, "If you didn't write it down, it didn't happened." Maybe it works the other way, too: "if I write it down, it will happen."<br />
